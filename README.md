# 🍏 _The Algorithm Ladder_ 🍏


## Description
**An old favorite, the [Algorithm Ladder](https://trello.com/b/smxNsfu6/algorithm-ladder), by Jay Wengrow.**

## Wat
* a tool for learning or practicing different programming languages
* a series of challenges, separated by category, increasing in difficulty over time.
* use to document your progress, or whatever, I don't even care

I often approach this as a mixture of whiteboarding (where you'll find my pseudocode all over) and algorithm basics.

## Context
_Use of the algo ladder provides easy and consistent access to realistic challenges. It also offers a variability of approach- skip around, pair with friends, use this tool however it works best for you! When learning a new language, use this tool yet again, but as a 1-to-1 easy comparison to where two languages approach problems differently._

 My favorite way to climb this ol ladder is by hanging out with a few friends on zoom. We each take a few minutes to work through a problem. Then, we compare answers and thoughts.
